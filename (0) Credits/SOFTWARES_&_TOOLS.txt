Pixel Arts:
    Aseprite
        is paid, but it's possible to use it for free. You just need to download the source code from their github and compile it yourself

    Pixel Studio
        a very good mobile app for making pixel arts

    PhotoShop
        i think it's possible to do the same thing i did with PhotoPea, which is free



Code Editing:
    Visual Studio Code (Also known as VS Code)
        for me, the best code editor for windows...

    ACode
        a mobile code editor, we don't have really good and complete code editors for Android
        but this one was the best one i could find

    Termux
        a linux terminal for Android, you can literally use github commands with it
        and i used NeoVIM on it for some code editing... But i didn't get comfortable with it yet



Others:
    BlockBench
        almost an official Minecraft model editor and creator. As it is very used by the community
        you can create models, animations, animation controllers and more...
        it's not official cause it's a third party software, not from Mojang or Microsoft

    Grok and ChatGPT
        as you probably know, these are AIs
        i used them to get some tips, solve errors and even create things (like generating pallets or designs)

    Git (or GitHub, if you prefer)
        this is a NEEDED tool if you're a developer (of anything)
        not really... but is a very good tool (this is a version control system)
